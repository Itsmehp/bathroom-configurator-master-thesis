  abstract = {Digitalization in the construction sector is a need of the modern world. Not only the infrastructure, but also the quality of life, is improved by the digital transformation in the construction sector. Digital technologies are being widely used in construction. The impacts of implementing digital technology on transformation in the construction industry, however, have not yet been thoroughly understood. Considering this aspect of the construction industry, this study reviews the articles in the field of digitalization of various segments in the construction industry. In this manner, the Scopus database was considered to gather the relevant articles based on the keywords (((``Digitalization'' OR ``Digitalisation'') OR ``Reforms'') AND ``Construction'' AND ``Energy''). These keyword combinations provided a list of 126 articles and, following the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the number was reduced to 35. The review showed that the major targeted areas in the construction sector based on digital transformation are smart construction, optimization of energy, sustainable environment, wireless technology, and economic and architectural growth in which the role of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and prefabricated construction is noteworthy. The involvement of digitalization in numerous fields has improved quality of life. It increases production and has the potential to automate the industry more effectively. This study shows how the adoption of digital technology has improved comprehension and laid the foundation for a digital transformation in the construction industry.},

  abstract = {Digital transformation powered by Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping renovation practices by addressing persistent challenges such as fragmented records, scheduling disruptions, regulatory delays, and inefficiencies in stakeholder coordination. This study explores the integration of these technologies through a case study of a Catholic church renovation (2022--2023) in Hong Kong, supplemented by insights from 10 comparable projects. The research proposes a practical framework for incorporating digital tools into renovation workflows that focuses on diagnosing challenges, defining objectives, selecting appropriate BIM/AI tools, designing an integrated system, and combining implementation, monitoring, and scaling into a cohesive iterative process. Key technologies include centralized BIM repositories, machine learning-based predictive analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and robotic process automation (RPA). The findings show that these tools significantly improve data organization, proactive planning, regulatory compliance, stakeholder collaboration, and overall project efficiency. While qualitative in nature, this study offers globally relevant insights and actionable strategies for advancing digital transformation in renovation practices, with a focus on scalability, continuous improvement, and alignment with regulatory frameworks.},

abstract = {Much of the work on conceptual modeling involves the use of an entity-relationship model in which binary relationships appear as associations between two entities. Relationships involving more than two entities are considered rare and, therefore, have not received adequate attention. This research provides a general framework for the analysis of relationships in which binary relationships simply become a special case. The framework helps a designer to identify ternary and other higher-degree relationships that are commonly represented, often inappropriately, as either entities or binary relationships. Generalized rules are also provided for representing higher-degree relationships in the relational model. This uniform treatment of relationships should significantly ease the burden on a designer by enabling him or her to extract more information from a real-world situation and represent it properly in a conceptual design.},

  abstract = {Several modern day problems need to deal with large amounts of spatio-temporal data. As such, in order to meet the application requirements, more and more systems are adapting to the specificities of those data. The most prominent case is perhaps the data storage systems, that have developed a large number of functionalities to efficiently support spatio-temporal data operations. This work is motivated by the question of which of those data storage systems is better suited to address the needs of industrial applications. In particular, the work conducted, set to identify the most efficient data store system in terms of response times, comparing two of the most representative of the two categories (NoSQL and relational), i.e. MongoDB and PostgreSQL. The evaluation is based upon real, business scenarios and their subsequent queries as well as their underlying infrastructures and concludes in confirming the superiority of PostgreSQL in almost all cases with the exception of the polygon intersection queries. Furthermore, the average response time is radically reduced with the use of indexes, especially in the case of MongoDB.},
