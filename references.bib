  abstract = {Digitalization in the construction sector is a need of the modern world. Not only the infrastructure, but also the quality of life, is improved by the digital transformation in the construction sector. Digital technologies are being widely used in construction. The impacts of implementing digital technology on transformation in the construction industry, however, have not yet been thoroughly understood. Considering this aspect of the construction industry, this study reviews the articles in the field of digitalization of various segments in the construction industry. In this manner, the Scopus database was considered to gather the relevant articles based on the keywords (((``Digitalization'' OR ``Digitalisation'') OR ``Reforms'') AND ``Construction'' AND ``Energy''). These keyword combinations provided a list of 126 articles and, following the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the number was reduced to 35. The review showed that the major targeted areas in the construction sector based on digital transformation are smart construction, optimization of energy, sustainable environment, wireless technology, and economic and architectural growth in which the role of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and prefabricated construction is noteworthy. The involvement of digitalization in numerous fields has improved quality of life. It increases production and has the potential to automate the industry more effectively. This study shows how the adoption of digital technology has improved comprehension and laid the foundation for a digital transformation in the construction industry.},

This study explores the integration of these technologies through a case study of a Catholic church renovation (2022--2023) in Hong Kong, supplemented by insights from 10 comparable projects. The research proposes a practical framework for incorporating digital tools into renovation workflows that focuses on diagnosing challenges, defining objectives, selecting appropriate BIM/AI tools, designing an integrated system, and combining implementation, monitoring, and scaling into a cohesive iterative process. Key technologies include centralized BIM repositories, machine learning-based predictive analytics, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and robotic process automation (RPA). The findings show that these tools significantly improve data organization, proactive planning, regulatory compliance, stakeholder collaboration, and overall project efficiency. While qualitative in nature, this study offers globally relevant insights and actionable strategies for advancing digital transformation in renovation practices, with a focus on scalability, continuous improvement, and alignment with regulatory frameworks.},

Relationships involving more than two entities are considered rare and, therefore, have not received adequate attention. This research provides a general framework for the analysis of relationships in which binary relationships simply become a special case. The framework helps a designer to identify ternary and other higher-degree relationships that are commonly represented, often inappropriately, as either entities or binary relationships. Generalized rules are also provided for representing higher-degree relationships in the relational model. This uniform treatment of relationships should significantly ease the burden on a designer by enabling him or her to extract more information from a real-world situation and represent it properly in a conceptual design.},

The most prominent case is perhaps the data storage systems, that have developed a large number of functionalities to efficiently support spatio-temporal data operations. This work is motivated by the question of which of those data storage systems is better suited to address the needs of industrial applications. In particular, the work conducted, set to identify the most efficient data store system in terms of response times, comparing two of the most representative of the two categories (NoSQL and relational), i.e. MongoDB and PostgreSQL. The evaluation is based upon real, business scenarios and their subsequent queries as well as their underlying infrastructures and concludes in confirming the superiority of PostgreSQL in almost all cases with the exception of the polygon intersection queries. Furthermore, the average response time is radically reduced with the use of indexes, especially in the case of MongoDB.},

However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users' long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function.},

In this paper, we explore the interior scene design task as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to produce an accurate position and size of the furniture simultaneously for the indoor layout task. In particular, we first formulate the furniture layout task as a MDP problem by defining the state, action, and reward function. We then design the simulated environment and train reinforcement learning agents to produce the optimal layout for the MDP formulation. We conduct our experiments on a large-scale real-world interior layout dataset that contains industrial designs from professional designers. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model yields higher-quality layouts as compared with the state-of-art model.

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.},

Leveraging cutting-edge technology in generative AI, our system can assist users in generating and editing indoor scene concepts quickly, given user text description and visual guidance. Using both visual guidance and language as the conditional inputs significantly enhances the accuracy and coherence of the generated scenes, resulting in visually appealing designs. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VIDES in developing new indoor concepts, changing indoor styles, and replacing and removing interior objects. The system successfully captures the essence of users' descriptions while providing flexibility for customization. Consequently, this system can potentially reduce the entry barrier for indoor design, making it more accessible to users with limited technical skills and reducing the time required to create high-quality images. Individuals who have a background in design can now easily communicate their ideas visually and effectively present their design concepts. https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/VIDES},

To circumnavigate this dependence, we propose an unsupervised 3D point cloud change detection method mainly based on self-supervised learning using deep clustering and contrastive learning. The proposed method also relies on an adaptation of deep change vector analysis to 3D point cloud via nearest point comparison. Experiments conducted on \textbackslash added\{an aerial LiDAR survey dataset\} show that the proposed method obtains higher performance in comparison to the traditional unsupervised methods, with a gain of about 9\textbackslash\% in mean accuracy (to reach more than 85\textbackslash\%).

abstract = {Recently, point cloud (PC) has gained popularity in modeling various 3D objects (including both synthetic and real-life) and has been extensively utilized in a wide range of applications such as AR/VR, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. For such applications, it is critical to analyze/understand the surrounding scenes properly. To achieve this, deep learning based methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) have been widely employed for higher accuracy. Unlike the deep learning on conventional 2D images/videos, where the feature computation (matrix multiplication) is the major bottleneck, in point cloud-based CNNs, the sample and neighbor search stages are the primary bottlenecks, and collectively contribute to 54\% (up to 80\%) of the overall execution latency on a typical edge device. While prior efforts have attempted to solve this issue by designing custom ASICs or pipelining the neighbor search with other stages, to our knowledge, none of them has tried to "structurize" the unstructured PC data for improving computational efficiency.In this paper, we first explore the opportunities of structurizing PC data using Morton code (which is originally designed to map data from a high dimensional space to one dimension, while preserving spatial locality) and observe that there is a huge scope to "skip" the sample and neighbor search computation by operating on the "structurized" PC data. Based on this, we propose two approximation techniques for the sampling and neighbor search stages. We implemented our proposals on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge GPU board. The evaluation results collected on six different workloads show that our design can accelerate the sample and neighbor search stages by 3.68\texttimes{} (up to 5.21\texttimes{}) with minimal impact on inference accuracy. This acceleration in turn results in 1.55\texttimes{} speedup in the end-to-end execution latency and saves 33\% of energy expenditure.},

The complementary information from these two sensors makes the two-modality fusion be a desired option. However, two major issues of the fusion between camera and LiDAR hinder its performance, \textbackslash ie, how to effectively fuse these two modalities and how to precisely align them (suffering from the weak spatiotemporal synchronization problem). In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine LiDAR and camera fusion-based network (termed as LIF-Seg) for LiDAR segmentation. For the first issue, unlike these previous works fusing the point cloud and image information in a one-to-one manner, the proposed method fully utilizes the contextual information of images and introduces a simple but effective early-fusion strategy. Second, due to the weak spatiotemporal synchronization problem, an offset rectification approach is designed to align these two-modality features. The cooperation of these two components leads to the success of the effective camera-LiDAR fusion. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show the superiority of the proposed LIF-Seg over existing methods with a large margin. Ablation studies and analyses demonstrate that our proposed LIF-Seg can effectively tackle the weak spatiotemporal synchronization problem.},
