# Implementation Challenges

*This section will discuss the challenges encountered during implementation, such as handling poor-quality scans, missing fixtures, and outdated JSON files.*

According to internal company interviews, the MagicPlan application exhibits certain limitations and anomalies, although no definitive cause has been identified. For instance, the scanner occasionally fails to generate accurate room plans for spaces with multiple walls (exceeding five walls). Additionally, niche showers are sometimes detected outside the boundaries of the room plan, and the walls in some rooms appear slightly misaligned.
