The principal objective of this thesis is to address the inefficiencies inherent in the manual quotation process for bathroom renovations by developing a functional prototype that automates the selection of shower enclosures. This study seeks to substantially reduce the time required by sales teams to produce accurate quotations and to enhance the customer experience by surpassing the limitations of current, non-integrated configurator tools.  
  
To accomplish this, the project will focus on the following key objectives:

   1. Develop an Intelligent Recommendation Engine: The core of the project is to create a system that can intelligently select optimal shower enclosures. This involves:
       * Designing and implementing intelligent product-matching algorithms for various shower configurations.
       * Creating a comprehensive product database that models product specifications and compatibility rules.

   2. Integrate Modern Data Capture Methods: To ensure accurate recommendations, the system will utilize precise measurements. This will be achieved by:
       * Designing a data integration pipeline to process room dimensions captured by the MagicPlan app using LiDAR technology.
       * Allowing for manual user input as an alternative for customers with existing floor plans.

   3. Deliver Actionable Output: The final recommendations must be usable for the sales process. The prototype will therefore:
       * Generate output in a structured format (such as JSON or PDF) to support quotation generation and integration with other software.
