# Problem Statement

The process of specifying and quoting shower enclosures within the bathroom renovation industry is characterized by significant operational inefficiencies that impede scalability, negatively impact profitability, and diminish the overall customer experience. As renovation companies expand their geographic service areas to a growing customer base, these challenges are exacerbated. The core problems can be categorized as follows:

### 1. Operational Inefficiencies in Manual Quoting

The conventional workflow for generating a customer quotation is a manually intensive and time-consuming process. A single customer engagement requires a sales representative to invest substantial time across several stages:

-   **Travel Time:** Approximately two to three hours are often dedicated solely to traveling to and from the customer's location.
-   **On-Site Assessment:** The assessment itself, which involves the meticulous measurement and documentation of the bathroom space, consumes an additional hour of a representative's time.
-   **Manual Office Work:** Following the on-site visit, the representative must return to the office to manually calculate costs, prepare a detailed quotation, and select suitable shower enclosures. This selection is frequently constrained by the customer's remaining budget after accounting for labor and other materials, adding a further layer of complexity.

This multi-stage, manual process creates a significant operational bottleneck, limiting the number of quotations a single representative can handle and thereby directly constraining business growth.

### 2. The Challenge of On-Site Product Configuration

A critical gap exists in the current workflow: the lack of intelligent, on-site product configuration. While some software solutions are emerging to digitize parts of the quoting process, they do not address the complex task of selecting a compatible and appropriate shower enclosure in real-time. This is a non-trivial step that depends on precise measurements, the layout of existing bathroom fixtures, and the customer's budget. As a result, it remains a task that is largely manual and disconnected from the rest of the quoting workflow.

### 3. Risk of Inaccuracy and Financial Loss

Manual data collection and product selection are inherently prone to human error. Incorrect measurements or the selection of incompatible components can lead to ordering custom-fit products that are unsuitable for the space. Such errors often result in:

-   **Direct Financial Loss:** Custom-ordered products are typically non-returnable, leading to sunk costs.
-   **Project Delays:** Re-ordering components and adjusting plans causes significant delays.
-   **Erosion of Customer Trust:** Errors in the quoting and ordering phase can severely damage the company's reputation and customer confidence.

### 4. Sub-optimal Customer Experience

The traditional process results in a fragmented and protracted customer journey. A long delay between the initial on-site visit and the receipt of a final, detailed quote can lead to customer disengagement. Furthermore, the customer is unable to visualize the proposed products within their own space, creating a potential mismatch between expectation and reality. This highlights the need for a more immediate and integrated solution to enhance the customer experience.

### Conclusion: A Timely Opportunity for Innovation

While these challenges are long-standing within the bathroom renovation sector, the recent integration of consumer-grade LiDAR sensors into common devices, such as smartphones and tablets, presents a novel and timely opportunity to address these inefficiencies comprehensively especially for growing businesses that cannot rely on slow customer engagement.
