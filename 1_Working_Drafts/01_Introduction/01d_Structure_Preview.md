# Preview of the overall structure (thesis structure)

This thesis is structured to systematically address the research problem and objectives, guiding the reader through the development and evaluation of the proposed LiDAR-based product recommendation system. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, culminating in a comprehensive analysis of the findings and future directions.

## Chapter Overviews:

*   **Chapter 1: Introduction**
    This introductory chapter sets the stage by outlining the research problem, establishing the thesis's purpose and objectives, and defining the scope of the study. It provides an overview of the challenges within the bathroom renovation industry and introduces the potential of LiDAR technology as a transformative solution.

*   **Chapter 2: System Requirements and Architecture Designing**
    This chapter delves into the detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the product recommendation system. It presents a thorough analysis of the existing state of the art and proposes the overall system architecture, including the chosen technology stack (Next.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM). Furthermore, it details the design of the data model crucial for storing product information and compatibility rules.

*   **Chapter 3: LiDAR Integration**
    Focusing on data acquisition, this chapter explores the integration of LiDAR technology into the system. It details the process of obtaining room scan data via the MagicPlan API, the subsequent data processing pipeline, and the methodologies employed for fixture recognition within the scanned environment. Challenges and solutions encountered during implementation are also discussed.

*   **Chapter 4: Intelligent Product Recommendation Algorithm**
    This chapter is dedicated to the core intelligence of the system. It describes the design and implementation of intelligent product-matching algorithms, encompassing both rule-based and graph-based approaches. The chapter elaborates on how these algorithms leverage processed LiDAR data and the comprehensive product database to generate optimal shower enclosure recommendations.

*   **Chapter 5: System Implementation**
    Detailing the practical development, this chapter outlines the implementation of the full-stack web application prototype. It covers the frontend development with Next.js and TypeScript, the backend services built with Express.js and TypeScript, and the integration with the PostgreSQL database. Key components and modules of the system are presented.

*   **Chapter 6: Testing and Evaluation**
    This chapter presents the methodology and results of the system's testing and evaluation. It covers the approaches taken to assess the prototype's performance, the accuracy of its recommendations, and its overall usability in addressing the identified industry inefficiencies.

*   **Chapter 7: Discussion of Findings**
    The discussion chapter interprets the results obtained from the testing and evaluation phase. It analyzes the implications of the findings, critically assesses the system's effectiveness in achieving its objectives, and compares its performance and approach with existing solutions or traditional methods.

*   **Chapter 8: Conclusion**
    This final chapter summarizes the key findings and contributions of the Master's Thesis. It reiterates how the research objectives were met, discusses the limitations of the study, and proposes directions for future work and further development of the system.

*   **Chapter 9: Bibliography**
    This section lists all academic papers, technical documentation, industry reports, and other sources cited throughout the thesis, formatted according to academic standards.

*   **Chapter 10: Appendix**
    The appendix includes supplementary materials such as detailed code snippets, extensive datasets, additional diagrams, or other relevant information that supports the main body of the thesis but is not essential for its immediate understanding.
