## 2.2 State of the Art and Approach

This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art in technologies relevant to this thesis, beginning with an analysis of LiDAR scanning applications for interior mapping. It then examines existing product recommendation and configuration systems to identify the current technological gaps, and finally, outlines the methodological approach adopted to address these gaps. The review begins with LiDAR technology, which was initially developed for terrain mapping in aeronautics and aerospace applications. It has since expanded into diverse domains such as autonomous vehicles, enabling these systems to navigate their environments effectively and generate three-dimensional imagery that can be transformed into Building Information Modeling (BIM) or Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models.

### 2.2.1 Introduction of LiDAR in edge devices


Owing to significant advances in laser diode technology, optics, and manufacturing, LiDAR systems have become smaller, more accessible, and cost-effective. [CITE SOURCE HERE] This miniaturization has paved the way for the integration of LiDAR into edge devices, a trend most prominently exemplified by its inclusion in consumer smartphones like the Apple iPhone Pro series and iPad Pro series. The presence of LiDAR in these devices has significantly broadened public access to sophisticated spatial scanning capabilities.

A variety of mobile applications have emerged to leverage these on-device sensors, including PolyCam, LumoScanner, and MagicPlan. Notably, such applications often existed prior to the integration of built-in LiDAR, previously relying on external, Bluetooth-enabled laser range finders for high-accuracy data capture. A comparative study of several of these scanning solutions provides strong academic validation for the choice of MagicPlan in this thesis. The study concluded that MagicPlan was the most effective and efficient method for as-built modeling, highlighting its superior performance in functionality, usability, and processing speed (9.02 m²/min) and awarding it the highest overall score of 4.26. These findings affirm that the company's incumbent tool is a robust and well-founded choice for the data acquisition phase of this project. [Musarat et al., 2023]

The LiDAR sensor, optimized for room scanning, measures distances up to 5 meters. However, its full potential is realized only when paired with sophisticated software applications like MagicPlan. By combining augmented reality (AR) with artificial intelligence (AI), MagicPlan automatically detects and classifies objects, capturing a scene's complete geometry beyond basic features like floors or walls. A LiDAR-derived room scan, where data is recorded, identified, and processed by AI, holds significant long-term value as the information remains accessible and reusable \cite{geibWhyApplesLiDAR}.

These sensors enable the creation of precise three-dimensional visualizations through dense point cloud data, providing valuable spatial information. MagicPlan’s proprietary processing software employs advanced algorithms and AI models to convert these visualizations into editable CAD models. While specific technical details and proprietary algorithms are not publicly disclosed, MagicPlan's integration with Apple’s RoomPlan API suggests a hybrid approach, combining AI-driven spatial recognition with sensor data processing for classifying and mapping interior objects \cite{geibWhyApplesLiDAR}.

The improved LiDAR scanner in devices like the iPad Pro and iPhone 12 Pro, coupled with specialized floor plan applications, significantly enhances accuracy in room dimensions and allows for the inclusion of richer detail in floor plans \cite{geibWhyApplesLiDAR}. This integration facilitates advanced visualization, web-based uploading of 2D floor plans and 3D models, and seamless information sharing. Critically, this technology can boost client acquisition through innovative engagement, serve as a basis for rapid material and cost estimates during initial site visits, and bolster quality assurance by enabling comparisons of renovation stages. The capacity to proactively detect errors and compare planned versus actual progress positions LiDAR room scans as invaluable, cost-saving roadmaps within the residential construction sector \cite{geibWhyApplesLiDAR}.  

### 2.2.2 Analysis of the Incumbent Product Configurator

While MagicPlan addresses spatial data acquisition, the second component of the established workflow is a manufacturer-provided, web-based product configurator. This section provides a state-of-the-art analysis of this incumbent tool, identifying the specific technical and functional limitations that are the root cause of the business and operational inefficiencies outlined in the Problem Statement. This tool, hosted on a B2B wholesale portal, is the primary instrument for specifying and ordering compatible shower enclosure components.

The configurator guides users through a hierarchical selection process to ensure component compatibility. It allows for the definition of several key parameters, such as:
*   **Entry Type:** Including corner shower (*Ecklösung*), alcove shower (*Nischenlösung*), walk-in shower (only 1 side-panel / door other side empty), and U-form configurations(multiple options 1 door 2 sidepanel, 2 doors, 1 sidepanel, 2 doors 2 sidepanels, half-circle(not-used)).
*   **Shower Style:** Such as a corner cabin (*Eckkabine*) or a corner entry with a full or shortened side panel (Only when there is a short sidewall present or a bathtub is beside the shower).
*   **Door Type:** Options include swing doors (*Pendeltür*), folding swing doors (*Faltpendeltür*), and sliding doors (*Gleittür*).
*   **Installation Details:** Including orientation and mounting type (floor-level or on a shower tray).

Based on these initial selections, the system subsequently recommends compatible components like side panels or doors. For these components, it provides critical dimensional data, including the minimum (*minEinbau*) and maximum (*maxEinbau*) construction range.

Despite its function in ensuring hardware compatibility, a critical analysis of the configurator reveals significant operational and technical limitations that justify the development of a new, integrated solution:

1.  **Lack of Real-Time Price Visibility:** The system does not display component pricing during the configuration process. Prices are only revealed after a product is added to the shopping cart. This limitation severely hampers the sales team, who must select products to fit a customer's budget after a partial quote has already been generated. The issue is exacerbated by a functional limit of thirteen shopping carts per user, which are reportedly always at full capacity.
2.  **Limited Product Options:** For any given selection, the configurator presents only a single product line, precluding the comparison of alternative products or styles that might be available.
3.  **B2B Exclusivity and Price Opacity:** As a wholesale portal, the platform is inaccessible to end-customers and displays the company's net acquisition costs. This lack of transparency makes it unsuitable for direct use in client consultations.
4.  **Outdated Product Data:** The configurator frequently omits new product configurations that are present in the manufacturer's official product catalog and even on the consumer-facing website. Accessing these newer options depends on an employee's specialized knowledge of the print catalog, creating a significant knowledge barrier for new hires and increasing the likelihood of suboptimal product selections.
5.  **No Integration Capabilities:** The tool is a closed, standalone system with no capacity for integration with external applications like MagicPlan. This results in a fragmented workflow that requires manual and error-prone data transfer from the room scan to the product configurator.
6.  **Closed Architecture:** The platform does not offer Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for accessing its product database, configuration logic, or cart system. This fundamentally prevents automation, data synchronization, or integration with other business-critical software.
7.  **Lack of Shower Tray Recommendation:** While the configurator prompts the user to select an installation type (with or without a shower tray), it does not subsequently recommend a compatible shower tray product. This omission creates an incomplete solution for a full shower replacement, forcing sales staff to manually identify and verify a suitable tray from a separate catalog. This represents a significant gap in providing a comprehensive and seamless customer solution.

In summary, the configurator's closed architecture, outdated data, and inefficient workflow are the direct technical sources of the operational bottlenecks, financial risks, and sub-optimal customer experiences described in the problem statement. This analysis proves that a significant technological gap exists, justifying the development of the modern, integrated, and intelligent product recommendation system proposed by this thesis.

The preceding analysis demonstrates that while powerful tools for spatial scanning and product configuration exist, they operate in isolation. This thesis addresses this critical gap.
Based on an evaluation of the available technologies, this project will utilize the MagicPlan application and its API for data acquisition and take data, configurator from the wholesale website. Subsequent chapters will provide a detailed account of the data processing methods and their application within the product recommendation algorithm.
