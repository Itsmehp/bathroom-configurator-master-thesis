# Blueprint: LiDAR in Construction and Renovation

## 1. Objective
*   To provide a comprehensive overview of LiDAR technology, its integration with edge devices, and its practical applications and impact on the construction and renovation industries.

## 2. Target Audience
*   Professionals in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sectors, project managers in renovation, and students or researchers exploring modern construction technologies.

## 3. Core Sections (Outline)
*   ### Section 1: Introduction to LiDAR Technology
    *   **Key Point:** Explain the fundamental principles of LiDAR, including how it uses light to measure distances and generate precise 3D data.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Define what a "point cloud" is and its role as the primary data output. (Reference: Finding 1 in RESEARCH.md)
*   ### Section 2: The Rise of LiDAR on Edge Devices
    *   **Key Point:** Discuss the shift from cloud-based processing to local processing on edge devices to enable real-time applications.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Detail the benefits (reduced latency, enhanced privacy) and challenges (power consumption, computational limits) of this approach. (Reference: Finding 2 in RESEARCH.md)
*   ### Section 3: LiDAR's Role in the Construction Industry
    *   **Key Point:** Detail the use of LiDAR across the construction lifecycle, from initial planning to final quality control.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Provide examples such as site surveying, progress monitoring against BIM, and ensuring structural compliance. (Reference: Finding 4 in RESEARCH.md)
*   ### Section 4: Transforming the Renovation Industry with LiDAR
    *   **Key Point:** Emphasize LiDAR's ability to capture precise "as-built" documentation of existing structures.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Explain how this accuracy is critical for custom-fit installations (like shower enclosures), reducing errors and material waste. (Reference: Finding 3 in RESEARCH.md)
*   ### Section 5: Challenges and Future Outlook
    *   **Key Point:** Address the current barriers to adoption and look toward the future of the technology.
    *   **Supporting Data:** Discuss challenges like equipment cost and data complexity, and future trends like the integration of AI/ML for automated data processing. (Reference: Executive Summary & Technical Context in RESEARCH.md)
