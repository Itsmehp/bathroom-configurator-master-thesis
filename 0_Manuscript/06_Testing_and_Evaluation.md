# Testing and Evaluation

## Testing Methodology

1.      Testing all routes using unit tests.

2.      API testing for middleware, error handling, validation, and database operations.

3.      End-to-end workflow tests

4.      Test data: More than 20 real bathroom floor plans

## Algorithm Accuracy

1.      Test scenarios: compact installations, standard installations, large installations, custom installation sizes.

2.      Success Metrics

3.      Failure Analysis

## Performance benchmark? (Response time, concurrent user load?)

## Data Quality and Consistency

1.      Added products are always good. If no minimum or maximum construction range is found, it always shows the width with 5 mm lower- and 10-mm higher construction ranges, respectively.

2.      Price Data Accuracy

3.      Relationship Graph

## Usability Evaluation

1.      User Feedback

2.      What is lacking?

3.      Accessibility?

## Comparison with Manual Process

1.      Time savings

2.      Error Reduction

3.      Consistency

4.      Scalability
