# Discussion of Findings

## Achievement of Objectives

1.      Deliverables Confirmation

2.      Project Deviations

3.      How is it better than the ML approach?

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

1.      Limitations of the Current Implementation

2.      Product catalog dependency and manufacturer availability

3.      Lack of 3D rendering

4.      LiDAR Device Limitation (iOS Only)

5.      Magicplan API Limitations

6.      No API available due to partner database limitations.

7.      Too many business logic constraints.

8.      No images of the user's bathroom; only a 2D floor plan is provided.

## Comparison with Alternative Approaches:

1.      Hassmann VIGOR Duschabtrennungskonfigurator: This configurator displays only one configuration at a time and does not show prices. The UI workflow is tedious, as prices are only shown when adding products to the cart, which is limited to 13 items in total. Additionally, the partner database contains all the data but the configurator is incomplete. There is no planned integration.

2.      Vigour 3D configurator only provides a general overview of products without displaying model numbers. It prompts users to contact the company or request a quote. (Pros: 3D visualization; Cons: no pricing information and no plan integration.)

3.      The DUKA 3D configurator only provides a high-level overview of products and prompts users to contact the company or request a quote. It includes 3D visualization but lacks pricing information and plan integration.
