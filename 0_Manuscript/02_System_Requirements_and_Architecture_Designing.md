# System Requirements and Architecture Designing

The successful development of such an application requires meticulously defined sed of requirements and a robust architectural design. For a system that requires accurate real-world data, precise measurements of fixtures, comprehensive database of products with precise measurements and business logic that gets used while selection process of a shower enclosure, this foundation phase is particularly critical. It ensures the implementation is not only technologically sound but also directly aligned with the user needs and business objectives.

The transition from a conceptual framework to a functional software requires a systematic approach to defining the system's intended behavior, constraints, and underlying structure. This chapter delineates the complete process of designing the LiDAR-based product recommendation system, beginning with a thorough analysis of functional and non functional requirements.

Following the requirement analysis, a review of the current state of the art in indoor scanning, 3d point cloud data processing, and configuration recommendation engines are presented. this review critically evaluates existing solutions and methodologies, thereby contextualizing the novel approach taken in this thesis. The chapter then transitions from the what to the how, presenting a detailed system architecture and justifying the chose of the technology stack. Finally, the chapter concludes with the logical data model design, providing a blueprint for how information is structured, stored and accessed within the PostgreSQL database, which serves as the backbone of the system's data-driven logic.
