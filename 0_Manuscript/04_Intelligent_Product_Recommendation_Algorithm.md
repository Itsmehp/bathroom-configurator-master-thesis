# Intelligent Product Recommendation Algorithm

## Product Database Structure

1.      Product Types (Scalable)

2.      Product styles (scalable)

3.      Orientation support (for showers)

4.      Opening Types (also scalable for showers)

## Product Relationship Graphs

1.      Type of Relationship

2.      Algorithm for Finding Compatible Side Panels and Trays Given a Door Selection

## Niche, corner entry, U-shape, walk-in (recommendation algorithms)

1.      Problem Definition, Compatibility Requirements, and Algorithm Logic and Selection for Each

## Scalable to accommodate more styles in the future.

1.      Added a door type table with styles.
